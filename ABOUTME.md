My persistence makes me who I am.

My goal in my career is to be a fullstack developer where I can always try to learn, not only do I want to act as a fullstack, but I have the dream of opening a Web Security company, I think about being able to do this company in Norway, which is really the place I want to live. This project aims to provide the user with comfort and confidence knowing that their data is always safe. I'm focused and objective, so I disapprove when someone tries to delay me in any way and I make the delay a learning experience so that it doesn't happen anymore, trying to follow my career.

I do where to reach my goals, I look for study, school, courses and even Youtube. Today I'm looking to learn as much as possible about all programming languages, being able to do any type of operation and project. This part may seem very complicated, but it's my area, it's where I feel comfortable and safe. I guarantee my work even with my competence. Quality and time have the same weight, that's my thinking.

My Hobbys include spending the day programming, making games, websites, databases, web attack and defense, and more. I also really enjoy playing the guitar, my initial dream was always to be a musician, but it's a career that depends on luck, I just work with certainties. I also like to play, some days I play with my wife, games of all kinds, the intention is to have fun... and sometimes to get stressed with each other *laughs*, but it happens.

My specialty is the ease with which I have to learn new skills and programming languages, problem solving, program optimization, leadership, code organization. So far I have Java, JavaScript, Python, C#, HTML, CSS, JQuery, Node.JS, .NET, MySQL, SQL, Express.JS and MongoDB.
